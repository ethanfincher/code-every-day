<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: April 7, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: did some coding challenges for class this morning, and started/launched my forever friend app!

**Thoughts** just getting everything connected on heroku and github and getting api keys and hiding them takes a lot of work! I did get heroku to sync with my main branch, so now whenever i push to main it will also push to heroku, which is cool!

### Day 3: April 8, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: did some python morning exercises today, and learned a little about cURL commands and oAUTH for my forever friend app!

**Thoughts** oAuth was cool to learn about, i still have to figure out how to get it to run using ajax within my reach program, but i made the get request and got all the data i need for my app within my terminal, so tomorrow i'm going to add that to my actual file

### Day 4: April 9, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Mainly worked on my forever friend application, that and learning python and django in class!

**Thoughts** OAuth is way harder then i thought, i added some XML Http requests in js, but still have a long way to go

### Day 5: April 10, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: More forever friends, finally got the OAuth to work, not gonna do much on the react side of things cuz im wiped, but super happy I got that to work!

**Thoughts** I've learned a lot about how API crud stuff works, and I've had to handle this pretty big piece of documentation, so this has been a great learning experience!

### Day 6: April 11, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: finished forever friends (or at least an MVP). styling is pretty basic, and i got my API keys hidden, everything is deplyoed and looking good

**Thoughts** im super happy to have finished this project, i think my cat is happy too. At some point I'd love to make a bigger program that looks better and has actual log in features for this project, I really like the concept and have a good base to work from.

### Day 7: April 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: tuned up forever friend and presented it today, then tackled some python and django in the afternoon, completely butchered it. I'll figure it out soon enough

**Thoughts** I've struggled with getting things to connect, and I named my program incorrectly when i made it, so just making a bunch of stupid mistakes. Gotta be more careful next time

### Day 8: April 13, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: more django work today, couldn't get my homework to work, put a lot of time into looking up and debugging but to no avail. Hopefully i can get some help with it, or restart it and figure out where i went wrong

**Thoughts** nothing very new, just kinda went backwords with django, but im sure itll click soon enough. i feel like i say that a lot
