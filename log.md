<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: April 7, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: did some coding challenges for class this morning, and started/launched my forever friend app!

**Thoughts** just getting everything connected on heroku and github and getting api keys and hiding them takes a lot of work! I did get heroku to sync with my main branch, so now whenever i push to main it will also push to heroku, which is cool!

### Day 3: April 8, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: did some python morning exercises today, and learned a little about cURL commands and oAUTH for my forever friend app!

**Thoughts** oAuth was cool to learn about, i still have to figure out how to get it to run using ajax within my reach program, but i made the get request and got all the data i need for my app within my terminal, so tomorrow i'm going to add that to my actual file
